Selenium Builder Plugin Crossbrowsertesting

CrossBrowserTesting.com plugin for Selenium Builder.  Allows you to do two things:

- interactively record and run scripts from Selenium Builder against browsers at CrossBrowserTesting.com.  Easy way to begin automating the cross browser testing process.
- save a selenium script to CrossBrowserTesting.com, and use it to drive our automated screenshot system.  This allows you to record a series of selenium steps and utilize these with our screenshot engine to take screenshots of a page that needs a few clicks or some data entered beforehand.
